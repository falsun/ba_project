The following is a piece of code.

```{r filename="test.R"}

# create cheesecakes
cheesecakes <- 2+2

# print cheesecakes
print(cheesecakes)

```

Short codes can also be inserted directly in the text: I'd like to order `{r} print(cheesecakes)` pieces of cheesecake.

Someone else who might like some cheesecake is @waltz2000.

this is a spelledd wrong.

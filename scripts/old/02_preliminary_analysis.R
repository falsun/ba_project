#   Description:  This script conducts the preliminary analysis for the DiD model.
#                 It loads the clean master dataset, creates a descriptive
#                 statistics table to check for pre-treatment balance, and
#                 generates a parallel trends plot to visually inspect the
#                 key DiD assumption.

# 1. SETUP: LOAD PACKAGES AND DATA -------------------------------------------

# pacman simplifies package management
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,    # Core data manipulation and visualization
  here,         # For robust, project-relative file paths
  gtsummary,    # For creating beautiful summary tables
  fixest,        # For event study model
  modelsummary
)

# Set a global option to prevent R from using scientific notation for numbers
options(scipen = 999)

# Load the master dataset created in the previous script
master_dataset <- readRDS(here("data", "processed", "master_dataset.rds"))

print("Master dataset loaded.")
glimpse(master_dataset)


# 2. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (BALANCE TABLE) ----------------------------------
# The purpose of this table is to compare the treatment and control groups
# on key variables *before* the treatment occurred.

print("Generating pre-treatment descriptive statistics table...")

# Filter the data for the pre-treatment period (2014-2022)
pre_treatment_data <- master_dataset %>%
  filter(year < 2022)

# Create the summary table using the gtsummary package
balance_table <- pre_treatment_data %>%
  # Select the variables we want to summarize
  select(
    group,
    sipri_milex_share_gdp,
    gdp_per_capita,
    gdp_growth,
    debt_gdp,
    unemployment_rate,
    lib_dem
  ) %>%
  # Create the summary table, stratified by the 'group' column
  tbl_summary(
    by = group,
    label = list( # Custom labels for clarity
      sipri_milex_share_gdp ~ "Military Spending (% GDP, SIPRI)",

# 3. PARALLEL TRENDS PLOT ----------------------------------------------------
# This plot visually inspects the key assumption of the DiD model: that the
# treatment and control groups were on parallel trends *before* the treatment.

print("Generating parallel trends plot...")

# First, calculate the annual mean of the dependent variable for each group
trends_data <- master_dataset %>%
  group_by(year, group) %>%

  # Add a vertical dashed line to mark the year of the invasion

    title = "Parallel Trends of Military Spending Before 2022",
    subtitle = "Average Military Expenditure as a Share of GDP (SIPRI Data)",

    y = "Military Spending (% of GDP)",

# 4. FORMAL PARALLEL TRENDS TEST (EVENT STUDY MODEL) ------------------------

# This makes the model specification clearer and more robust for iplot().
master_dataset <- master_dataset %>%

# --- AND HERE: Rewritten model formula for clarity ---
# We now interact the 'year' factor with the new 'is_treatment' dummy.
# We also remove 'year' from the fixed effects, as it's implicitly handled by i().
event_study_model <- feols(
  sipri_milex_share_gdp ~ i(year, is_treatment, ref = ref_year) +
    gdp_per_capita + gdp_growth + debt_gdp + unemployment_rate + lib_dem |
